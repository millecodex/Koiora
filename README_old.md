# Koiora Project
Proof of Concept for event logging to Polygon's Mumbai testnet. Polygon is an Ethereum layer 2.

## Pre-requirements
1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/); to update: `sudo npm install npm@latest -g`
2. [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/); instructions [here](https://learnubuntu.com/install-node/)

## Requirements
1. [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) provides a connection to the blockchain, in this case the Polygon testnet Mumbai. This is in lieu of running your own node.
2. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) provides a developer environment so that we can easily configure environments, settings, and tests.
3. [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) is a Javascript SDK that provides a nice developer experience when you're writing code by wrapping lower-level JSON-RPC API calls.
